## Overview
With the application of artificial intelligence, AI has become a powerful tool to realize practical requirements in various fields. Recently, knowledge graphs, as a cornerstone of AI, have been widely published on the Web. In order to allow knowledge graphs in various fields to be accessed and used by all end-users, we have developed an interactive visual query language, called KGVis, which can break the bound between query patterns and query results. Furthermore, KGVis can gradually guide end-users to construct the query pattern and transform it into the query result.

## Publication
The paper "KGVis: An Interactive Visual Query Language for Knowledge Graphs" has been published on DASFAA 2019 as demo paper.
